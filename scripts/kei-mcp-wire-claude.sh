#
# Claude Code reads MCP servers from ~/.claude/settings.json `mcpServers`
# block. We don't strictly need kei-mcp here (Claude's native PreToolUse
# hooks already enforce policy), but adding it gives Claude access to
# `spawn_agent` for cross-CLI sub-agent dispatch.

  (v0.46: CLAUDECODE/GROKCODE env-skip was removed — the chain runs
   always now. Native PreToolUse hooks fire on tool_name='Bash'/'Edit'/
   'Write', but MCP tools are named kei_bash/kei_edit/kei_write, so
   native hooks would NOT fire anyway — there is no double-enforcement
   to avoid. Empty env block left in case operators add their own vars.)
